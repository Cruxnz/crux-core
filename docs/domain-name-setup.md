# Setting up a domain name with DO

First of all, purchase your domain name from whatever site is the cheapest and doesn't look too dodgy. I used https://www.crazydomains.co.nz. Great name.

Next, the tricky part. You need SSL like Mick Jenkins needs water. Let's encrypt provides free SSL certificates, so I recommend you get yo broke ass over there. https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/.
